For this project
The goal of this project is to create a personal website that showcases your skills, experiences, and interests.
A hero section that provides a brief introduction to you and your background.

A resume page that lists your education, work experience, skills, and other relevant information (you can link to Capstone project 1).

A section that showcases any projects or work that you have done in the past.

An about me section that provides additional information about you and your interests.

A contact me section that includes information for users to get in touch with you.
