For this project
The goal of this project is to create a personal website that showcases your skills, experiences, and interests.
A hero section that provides a brief introduction to you and your background.

A resume page that lists your education, work experience, skills, and other relevant information (you can link to Capstone project 1).

A section that showcases any projects or work that you have done in the past.

An about me section that provides additional information about you and your interests.

A contact me section that includes information for users to get in touch with you.

1- What is My Identity
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, well a funny question, i am not a cat i am man
i am muslim and my name is zaharadeen muhammad, from kano state nigeria.
i am 23 years old,

2- What is your past
well not much to say, usually when we say not much to say, it's about things we are not proud of.
well thats my life, nothing heinouis but nothing to be proud of, so its a 23years of headlessnees
from henceforth if i am blessed with more days, i want it to be different, and Allah is helping me cause yesterday was way more different than the day before yesterday.

3- what do you want to do
well from this month to the end of the year, i want to build a hause-novels site, that is the main project
if we are talking about my life then i want nothing but a purpposeful life and a peaceful death.

5- what enlightenment do you find, from your adventures
alot aactually, i learn about greediness that it's not only about materialistic stuff but also about concepts and oppurnities, there is so many oppurtunities so many paths but you can't follow all of them you can't be greedy, you can only choose one path cause if not, you will end up chewing up more than you can digest and end of sick and from where you started, that is the story of my life, decision making is good and hard, but sticking to the decision is even more harder.

6 -are you married, if yes how is it, if no, tell me about it
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, nope, not yet, but i plan on getting married, in the future in sha Allah,
i currently have no girlfriend, and for to end of the year i dont plan on having any,
the current girlfriend is my project(hausa-novel) and she is quite jealous.

6- what do you think about life
to think about life you have think about death, and death is ineveitable, it frightens me but gives me peace.
but to ensure the peace of the future you have to ensure the peace of now, and what better way to ensure the peaceful now other than a purposeful now. "So, pursuit of peace"ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ yeah that's what i think about life.

7- are a good man
no i don't think so, i dont think i am a good man, but i am a man who aspires and wants to be a good man

8- are you hardworking
in the last three days and counting inshaAllah

9- where do you see yourself in the coming year.
with how life and death are flicky, i don't know, but where i want to see my self in the coming year, is with a successful novel-site created a hub for readers authors and publishers, a hub full of fire and peace.
created by a good hardworking honest and disciplined man.
