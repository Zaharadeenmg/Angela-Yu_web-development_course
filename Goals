Web development why i choose to learn
 
 i want to create a site that will publish and update hausa books, i want to bring the hausa culture to the world.
 
 i have my own idea on how i want the site to be.
 
 but 3 sites will be my major tempalate sites,
 1 novel-usb
 2 webnovel
 3 wuxiaworld
 
 all my practices will be on this sites, trying to recreate their design.
 
 the best way to learn as i learn is through repeating.
 so i will open a file for each video for any lesson i learn
 
 so how do i plan for the site tobe 
 well for readers 2 people exist those drawn by shiny shiny things, and those drawn by simplicity.
 but all of them at the end only want comfort and nothing more, just a comforting design and the words font and the backgroung color that donot affect the eyes, and that is the site they will get.
 i want to design a site for both of them, just like how binance have the simple an complex view.
 the complex will be for the webnovel the simpler one will be the novel-usb
 i will concentrate more on the website, and the handset format a little on the tablet, yeah i think about apps and the computer sites but for now i will only concentrate on the phone and the site.
 
 i want the site to be for the reader main purpose, then for the authors, then the publishers, i want to make the authors and translator celebrities, and i want the readers to connect with each other.
