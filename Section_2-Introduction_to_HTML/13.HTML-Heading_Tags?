well we use it for heading

it has an opening tag and a close tag 
<h1></h1> with h1 being the biggest and then grow smaller to h6 as the last

rules or guidelines for using heading tags is one
dont repeat h1 more than once, 2 don't skip a heading tag like going from h1 to h3 go form h1 then h2 then to h3 and beyond gradually
